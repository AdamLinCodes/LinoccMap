# LinoccMap (Lin Occurrence Map)
### Inspiration
I have been doing a lot of leet code recently, and several of the problems I could have been made cleaner by a Map data structure that easily increments and decrements based on occurences.

### Current Status
Currently, the LinoccMap only keeps track of occurrences without. Next step will be looking optimization and updates to the map.
